## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 16.0+ target device or simulator
- Apple Developer Account (for device testing)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Project**
   - Extract all provided files to a folder named `SnoreRecorder`
   - Ensure the folder structure matches the project layout shown below

2. **Open in Xcode (Multiple Options)**

   **Option A: Direct Xcode Project**
   ```bash
   open SnoreRecorder.xcodeproj
   ```

   **Option B: If Option A fails, try:**
   ```bash
   # Open Xcode first, then File > Open > select SnoreRecorder.xcodeproj
   open -a Xcode
   ```

   **Option C: Alternative Swift Package approach:**
   ```bash
   # Create a new iOS app in Xcode, then add the source files manually
   # Or try opening the Package.swift file
   open Package.swift
   ```

   **Option D: Manual Setup (if all else fails):**
   1. Open Xcode
   2. Create new iOS App project
   3. Name it "SnoreRecorder"
   4. Choose SwiftUI interface and iOS 16+ deployment
   5. Replace the generated files with the provided source files
   6. Add the Info.plist configurations manually

3. **Configure Bundle Identifier**
   - Select the project in Xcode navigator
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities" tab
   - Change bundle identifier to something unique (e.g., `com.yourname.SnoreRecorder`)

4. **Set Development Team**
   - In "Signing & Capabilities", select your development team
   - Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked

5. **Build and Run**
   - Select your target device or simulator (iOS 16+ required)
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run
   - If you get build errors, try Product > Clean Build Folder first

### Required Permissions

The app will automatically request the following permissions:

- **Microphone Access**: Required for audio recording
- **Background App Refresh**: Allows continued recording when app is backgrounded

### First Launch Setup

1. Grant microphone permission when prompted
2. The app will show the main recording interface
3. Tap the blue record button to start your first recording
4. Test background recording by locking your phone during recording

## Usage Guide

### Recording Sleep Audio

1. **Start Recording**
   - Open the app and go to the "Record" tab
   - Optionally enable "Schedule Recording" and set duration
   - Tap the large blue microphone button
   - Place your phone near your bed (nightstand recommended)

2. **During Recording**
   - The app shows real-time volume levels
   - Recording continues even when phone is locked
   - You can check progress by unlocking your phone

3. **Stop Recording**
   - Unlock your phone and open the app
   - Tap the red stop button
   - Recording is automatically saved

### Viewing Analysis

1. **Automatic Analysis**
   - If auto-analysis is enabled (default), analysis starts automatically
   - Manual analysis can be triggered from the Analysis tab

2. **View Results**
   - Go to "History" tab to see all recordings
   - Tap any recording to view detailed analysis
   - Check "Analysis" tab for trends and insights

### Settings & Customization

- **Auto-analyze**: Automatically analyze recordings when completed
- **Audio Quality**: Choose recording quality (higher = larger files)
- **Storage Management**: Set auto-delete timeframe
- **Data Export**: Export your data for external analysis

## Key Features Explained

### Background Recording Technology
The app uses iOS background audio capabilities to continue recording even when:
- Phone is locked
- App is minimized
- Device is in sleep mode

This is achieved through:
- Audio background mode declaration in Info.plist
- AVAudioSession configuration for background recording
- Background task management to handle app lifecycle

### Local AI Analysis
All audio analysis happens on your device using:
- **Audio Feature Extraction**: RMS energy, zero-crossing rate, spectral analysis
- **Snore Detection**: Pattern recognition algorithms
- **Machine Learning**: Core ML models for classification
- **Privacy Protection**: No data leaves your device

### Real-time Visualization
The recording interface shows:
- Live volume meter with color-coded intensity
- Real-time volume history chart
- Recording duration timer
- Current volume level numeric display

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All audio analysis happens on-device
- **No Cloud Upload**: Audio files never leave your device
- **Data Control**: You can delete recordings anytime
- **Encryption**: Data stored using iOS secure storage
- **No Analytics**: No usage data is collected or transmitted

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Recording doesn't work**
- Ensure microphone permission is granted
- Check if another app is using the microphone
- Restart the app and try again

**Background recording stops**
- Ensure Background App Refresh is enabled for the app
- Check battery optimization settings
- Avoid force-closing the app during recording

**Analysis fails**
- Ensure sufficient storage space available
- Try analyzing shorter recordings first
- Restart the app if analysis seems stuck

**Poor recording quality**
- Adjust audio quality settings
- Ensure phone is close enough to detect snoring
- Check for background noise interference

### Performance Optimization

- **Storage**: Regularly delete old recordings
- **Battery**: Use scheduled recording to avoid all-night recording
- **Quality**: Use lower quality settings for longer recordings
- **Analysis**: Enable auto-analysis only when needed

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **SwiftUI**: Modern, declarative UI framework
2. **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Combine Framework**: Reactive programming for data flow
4. **Core Data**: Robust local data persistence
5. **Singleton Services**: Shared state management

### Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Export to health apps (HealthKit integration)
- Sleep stage detection
- Integration with smart home devices
- Collaborative analysis with healthcare providers
- Machine learning model improvements
